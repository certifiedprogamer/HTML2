    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      R.E.P.O is a new co-op horror game with up to six players where you and
      your gang of goons break into houses and steal everything that isnt nailed
      down whilst avoiding monsters <em>(the homeowners)</em> in order to
      appease your creator, the taxman. Very fun with stupid friends so i give
      it a <strong>&#9733;8/10</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>Things I like</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every monster can be killed one way or another, and the ingame shop that
        you go to after every level always supplies something to help you with
        that
      </li>
      <li>
        There are multiple ways to revive friends if they happen to die during a
        level.
      </li>
      <li>You can buy a shotgun</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Things I don't like</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some of the bigger objects crumble into dust instantly when they hit the
        smallest bump, losing all their value
      </li>
      <li>
        Weapons like the frying pan need to be recharged after enough use and
        dont do enough damage to be worth their price or the risk taken by using
        them.
      </li>
    </ul>

      HELLDIVERS 2 is a co-op third person shooter that can be played with up to
      4 players. Your job as a helldiver is to save freedom and democracy from
      the clutches of tyrrany with a large variety of weapons and stratagems at
      your disposal. I give it a strong <strong>&#9733;9/10</strong>. Very fun.
